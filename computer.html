            <p class="text">
              The culmination and intersection of many of my interests in Sophomore year of highschool from robotics and programming to video gaming, 3D modeling, and video editing spurred me to research and educate myself on a tool I constantly use academically and extracurricularly.
            <h2>Parts</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              When it came to finally creating a parts list, not an unrealistic amalgmation of only the best hardware as was the composition of many of my wishlists at the time, but searching for the perfect balance between power, noise, aesthetics, and finances was a time consuming and doubt inducing task. This computer was easily my largest financial investment at this point in my life and I had to make sure that everything was compatible physically and in the software.<br>

            <h2>Assembly</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              To understand something conceptually and to be capable of bringing something to realization are two very different things. Using a combination of the information I had acquired and the problem solving abilities I had developed, I was able to analyze any issues that occured and find solutions.

             <h2>Further Work</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              In my senior year of highschool, I took AP Computer Science 2 during which we used a software called Logisim to create simulate logic circuits and we proceeded to build an 8-bit memory, a CPU, and then a computer beginning only with NAND gates.
              I help friends build computers and maintain servers.
