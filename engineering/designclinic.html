              A full year senior engineering capstone sponsored by Werfen (a medical device company). Working with two other teammates in order to design a mechanism to open reagent bags in the GEM family of analyzers.

              I took the technician exam and then the general exam shortly thereafter while in college (January 2024).

              I am a technical director for <a href="https://sophia.smith.edu/org/wozq/about.html">WOZQ 91.9 FM </a>(Smith College's radio club) which entails providing technical support for the radio station equipment and training new radio show hosts on how to use said equpiment. My experience in theatre regarding sound has required mic'ing actors (which uses radio waves in order to transmit and recieve the audio information). My interest in electronics and electromagnetic waves (from Signals and Systems) has manifested in unit/lesson plans and a lesson I taught in a college course on how to teach engineering and science. A lot of this also overlapped when I built my own partscaster guitar, requiring an understanding of electricity and magnetic fields paired with music.
