            <h2>Motivation/Research</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Entering the summer before my senior year of highschool having spent the past year thinking and working to discover, remember, and document the history of disabled people in America, I found myself trying to renew my interest in reading recreationally by teaching myself braille. Through a simple introductory book, I learned about the history, grades, and languages of braille and practiced it until I could read basic children's books I would checkout from the library. With an urge to learn more, I recognized that I more easily learned languages through typing and so I looked into braille keyboards with which I could practice writing my summer homework assignments at the time. Unfortunately, all of the keyboards were either keyboards with the standard QWERTY layout (which I already had memorized and therefore would be unhelpful) or exceptionally expensive medical devices that was not in my budget.
            <h2>Applying My Skills</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              By this point in my life, I had a solid grasp of 3D printing (BME prosthetic hand project) and programming with some experience soldering. Keyboard knowledge also came from when I built my own computer. I purchased a basic kit for constructing, soldering, and programming a nine key keyboard, cherry mx switches, and 3D printed my own keycaps. There was one unforunate major concession I had to made which was the depressible and toggleable switch I wanted unfortunately it was discontinued a couple decades prior so I ended up programming that aspect in rather than it being a tactile toggle.          
            </p>
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Braille letters are formed by different arrangements of dots so I determined
that all letters could be formed using only six keys each with one dot. My original plan was to
create a 2x3 keyboard and then add an extra “submit” button. However, I quickly ran into a
problem: the smallest motherboard I could find was for a 3x3 key layout. Thus, in addition to the
“submit” key I could add 2 more keys The first key I added was the “delete” key. While having all
of the dots in each cell extruded would indicate a cross out in a book, I realized that since
humans have 5 fingers, it would be more ergonomic to add a “delete” key rather than press all 6
keys in the 2x3 part of the keyboard. The final key I decided to add was a “return” key.
To help visualize how this would work, here is how you write the word “den” using my
keyboard where the bolded “x”’s indicate which keys you would press for each letter.

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              My project accomplished several things. First, designing and making a keyboard with
only 9 keys would reduce travel time from one key to the next. Second, it was a simpler
design than larger keyboards and thus easier to use for someone who is visually
impaired. Finally, the overall project helped me increase my familiarity with braille as
well as practice soldering and programming in C.
My next step is to take a trip to Perkins School for the Blind and get some
feedback and suggested improvements. While the market for the keyboard I designed,
programmed and built is relatively small, I believe it is more compact, less expensive,

and even faster to type with than the inexpensive versions on the market.
