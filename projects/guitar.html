            <h2>Motivation/Research</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I have played acoustic guitar since second grade and for a long time I was irrationally and vehemently against electric guitars. As my interest in woodworking and proficiency in soldering has grown, as well as my experience in audio, I undertook a project to restore a 50-year old flamenco guitar that had been in the family for decades. After that was a reasonable success, I wanted to continue my newfound skills as a luthier and decided to attempt building my own electric guitar which I learned is called a partscaster.
            <h2>Parts</h2>

            <h2>Assembly</h2>

              The assembly took significantly longer than expected. Finding things not working perfectly and trying to not damage any components was a time consuming process.

             <h2>Further Work</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              In the second semester of my sophmore year and first semester of my junior year of college, I took circuits then signals and systems respectively. These classes helped me gain a greater understanding of how the pickups work from understanding basic circuits to building an A.M. Radio as an in-class activity.
