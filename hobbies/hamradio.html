            <h2>Motivation</h2>

              Taking the engineering class Signals and Systems in college and having a growing interest in sound from theatre I found out about ham radio and was instantly intrigued and insprired by the privelege and power it unlocked. While talking to people around the world was disinteresting to me (due to my social naxiety and certainly not my disinterest to meeting new people), the public service aspect of ham radio also deeply appealed to me as I constantly search and believe that my (and every peron's) purpose on this earth is to make this world a better place.
            <h2>Licensure</h2>

            <p class="text">
              I took the technician exam and then the general exam shortly thereafter while in college (January 2024).

            <h2>Academics</h2>

              I am a technical director for WOZQ 91.9 FM (Smith College's radio club) which entails providing technical support for the radio station equipment and training new radio show hosts on how to use said equpiment. My experience in theatre regarding sound has required mic'ing actors (which uses radio waves in order to transmit and recieve the audio information). My interest in electronics and electromagnetic waves (from Signals and Systems) has manifested in unit/lesson plans and a lesson I taught in a college course on how to teach engineering and science. A lot of this also overlapped when I built my own partscaster guitar.

            <p class="text">
              I hope to continue to bring my interest in ham radio into my life and pursue further learning on it whether that entails taking the amateur extra exam or related radio engineering courses
